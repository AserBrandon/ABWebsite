<div class="diaindent">
It was a hot and humid morning in Cebu, Philippines, as the cuckle-doo of the roosters woke me up like Sleeping Beauty.</div>
Lloyd and I were changing to the clothes we prepared weeks ago for the most life-changing event of our lives.
<div class="diaindent">
“Ready to go?” Mom said as she was pushing the luggage to our Vios car. <br>
“Yes, we’re ready! Jinx!” Lloyd and I laughed boisterously. <br>
</div>

We went inside our car and started driving to the airport miles away from our house. Lloyd asked Mom, <br>
<div class="diaindent">
“What’s San Francisco like, mom?” <br>
“It wouldn’t be much of a surprise if I tell you,” Mom replied with a giggle. <br>
</div>

Both my eyes and Lloyd’s met and glistered like the constellations we saw last night. We arrived at the airport and said goodbye to my aunt, who was tearing up gallons full of tears. I hid mine, unlike my brother who was ready to cry.
</p>

<p>
<div class="diaindent">We entered the airport that was as huge as Noah’s Ark. It was as if a resort and a barn had a baby, not that I’m against it. It</div>
wasn’t like that before, the old airport was as old as the Pantheon. We lined up to check-in and went through immigration for 2 hours. Those 2 hours in Immigration, however, were so frightening, it was like the feeling of riding a rollercoaster for the first time. It was 10 minutes before our time to board, and Lloyd just decided to buy a drink. He said,
<div class="diaindent">
“Kuya! Can we buy the milkshake?”
<br>“Why didn’t you buy that thirty minutes ago?!” I held down my scream. 
<br>“C’mon! It’s just on the other side,” Lloyd was desperate in getting the milkshake.
</div>
In the span of 10 minutes, he ran to the other side of the airport to buy the milkshake he wanted. We even lined up without him, and Mom was so worried about him. He arrived right when we were about to enter the boarding gate. 
<div class="diaindent">
“Thanks for the money,” Lloyd uttered his words with a smirk on his face.
<br>“When we get to America, you pay me 100 dollars,” I replied while pinching his chubby cheeks.
<br>“You two, stop fighting!” Mom said looking down at us like an angry granny.
</div>
I let go of Lloyd’s cheeks before Mom would turn to something much more sinister. 
</p>

<p>
<div class="diaindent">We went inside the huge Boeing 777-300 plane that was completely overwhelming. However, I was expecting a much </div>
more welcoming greeting from the flight attendants. All they did was stare at us as if we were different from them. Lloyd didn’t let it slip away though, so he greeted them,
   
<div class="diaindent">“Hello!” </div>
So the stewardess forced a fake smile quickly and replied,

<div class="diaindent">“Hi there young man! You too Ma’am! Hello there good sir.” </div>
My body shivered as if something was wrong, but Mom and Lloyd just let it slide. We entered the plane and walked to our economy seats miles away from the front entrance. Lloyd was super excited thinking about the movies he’s going to watch while the plane is flying. We took our seats and everything was normal, yet everyone seemed too quiet. The instructional video was beautiful and Lloyd’s jaw dropped when he felt the plane moving. We hoped nothing bad would happen during take-off and everything seemed safe. My eyes were drawn to the window as the sun sets with it’s beautiful colors. I even thought it smiled at me.
</p>

<p>
As the fragrant smell of dinner were brought to all passengers, Lloyd’s stomach growled like a roar of a lion. 
<div class="diaindent">“My bad!” he said. 
<br>“She’s hungry!” both Mom and I laughed pretty hard. 
</div>
The flight attendant placed our dinner onto our tables and I said,
<div class="diaindent">“Don’t open it yet. Let’s do it together in THREE, TWO, ONー”</div>
The lights went off as the plane started to experience turbulence. Someone screamed at the distance, and Lloyd whispered,

<div class="diaindent">“What is happening?”
<br>“I don’t know,” Mom and I said in harmony.
</div>
Five minutes of silence passed and the lights were turned on again. Lloyd noticed something,

<div class="diaindent">“Where is... EVERYONE?”</div>
Everyone was gone from their seats and as we looked at our dinner, cockroaches and mice started to come out of the plate. Mom pushed the plate and screamed,

<div class="diaindent">“Let’s get out of here!”</div>
We ran to the back of the plane as quickly as possible and hid at the galleys. Lloyd and I started crying. Mom said,

<div class="diaindent">“Don’t worry, I know we will be safe.”</div>
The plane was above the Pacific Ocean for 9 hours as we were patiently waiting if there’s any signs of landing. There was a huge bang, and the lights went off. 

<div class="diaindent">
“Do not make a sound,” Mom said with a frantic voice behind her reassuring face. 
<br>“Mayday!” the captain spoke through the loud, screaming speakers. 
<br>“Remain ca‒” the captain’s voice went shut.
</div>
There was a moment of silence. Suddenly, the lights went on and we heard what seemed like people talking. When we got out of the galley, there were people who started eating. We were confused about what we just witnessed. As we were beginning to eat, we can’t help but notice that Mom turned pale. We asked, 
<div class="diaindent">“Are you okay?” She nodded in reply.</div>
Soon after, the captain spoke through the speakers, 

<div class="diaindent">“We are landing to our final destination.”</div>
We were excited as we felt the plane landing. When Lloyd looked to the distance he asked, 

<div class="diaindent">
“Is SF’s Airport similar to Cebu’s Airport?”
<br>"No, I don’t think so,” Mom shook her head.
</div> 
We got our bags and went out of the plane. The weather was hot and humid. The airport staff were even  speaking in Cebuano, not English. Lloyd and I said in confusion and harmony, 
</p>

<p>
<i class="textitalic">Mom, I think… this is… Cebu.</i>

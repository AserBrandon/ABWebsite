<div class="diaindent"> It was 10 minutes past 11 in the evening when Angela, an assistant nurse who worked for the general hospital, got out of her </div> 
hectic and busy work schedule. She took her two year-old earphone and plugged it into her iPhone 7 Plus. Angela placed her small thumb on the fingerprint scanner, and opened her contacts to contact her boyfriend. Her boyfriend, Mark, answered his phone,

<div class="diaindent">
 “Hey babe, are you now out of work?” <br>
“Yeah, I am. Today is such a hectic day. By the way, I’m taking the bus.” <br>
“Oh, you didn’t drive to work today?” <br>
“Yeah, my sister borrowed it. I gotta go, the bus is coming.” <br>
“Okay, bye! Love you.” <br>
“Love you too.” <br>
</div>
</p>

Angela’s face went pink, flabbergasted by Mark’s cool and lovely tone. She placed her phone inside her black, winter jacket, and stood at the bus stop alone. As the bus stop displayed that the bus will arrive in a minute, Angela felt a thug in her left arm. She went shut, and started to sweat as if she’s in a desert. Slowly turning back, she saw an innocent old lady carrying her groceries. Angela thought the herself,
Why would an old lady buy groceries at this hour? Are the stores even still open?
She was skeptical yet the lady’s innocence overpowered her untrust. The lady smiled at her sinisterly, and Angela smiled back at her. Quickly avoiding eye-contact, she looked back at the clock, realizing that the bus was already in front of her. She was confused, but decided to go on the bus and sat at the back, opening the windows even though it was 49 °F. The old lady sat on the priority seats, which eased Angela’s heart.
